Sample illustrating mapping from a certificate cn to a MCAUSER. 

In [client-cert.yaml](client-cert.yaml) a commonName 'mqclient1' is defined, which is mapped to a principal 'mqclient1' in [configmap.yaml](configmap.yaml)

To setup a keystore for testing with MQ Explorer, download tls.crt and tls.key from 'mq-client-certificate-tls-secret' and do:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -in tls.crt -inkey tls.key -out certificate.p12 -name “certificate”
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore certificate.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore keystore-client.jks
```
